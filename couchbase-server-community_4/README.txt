COUCHBASE SERVER

Couchbase Server is an open source, distributed NoSQL document
database. It exposes a fast key-value store with managed cache
for sub-millisecond data operations, a powerful query engine for
executing SQL queries, and purpose-built indexers for fast queries.

Couchbase Server enables developers to build applications with
agility by leveraging the power of SQL with the flexibility of JSON.

By providing a flexible data model, consistent high performance,
elastic scalability, and always-on availability, Couchbase Server
enables enterprises to operate at any scale.

Its memory-centric architecture is designed to provide low-latency
data management for large-scale interactive web, mobile, and IoT
applications.

Couchbase Server runs in the cloud or on commodity hardware.

The server automatically starts after installation and the
web-based console is available on port 8091 (default). Refer to
the documentation for setup instructions.
